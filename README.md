# wmii column resizer script

The purpose of this script is to automatically resize the columns in wmii to 
be the same width. This is useful if you want to maintain a clean look, and
not be worried to ever change the width of a column. 

#Usage

Simply put wmequalizer.py in your PATH, and run it from the command line to do
the resizing. It is most useful to bind this to a key in your wmiirc file, such
a $MODKEY-equal (to act like the similar vim feature).
